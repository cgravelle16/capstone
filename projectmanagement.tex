\section{Project Management}

From the beginning, project management was an important tool used to keep our team working efficiently and on time  to be able too build and finish our proposed final design. Do to the inherent structure of the course, we added two main milestones, the design and build phase.The first haft of our semester was dedicated to designing our solution to the problem. During this time, we created a work schedule using WBS (Work Breakdown Structure) to get a better visual understanding of the scope and after created our initial Gantt chart. Since the first scope breakdown, the WBS and Gantt chart underwent many revision because of the fluctuating scope of work of our project kept adjusting to what would be reasonably possible to complete in the allocated amount of time. The final WBS can be found~\ref{fig:wbs] in Appendix~\ref{wbs}.

During the building phase, it became evident of the amount of work needed to finish the project. Milestones were set at many point to ensure that we kept on schedule. Our first major milestone was to get the first outer drive box completed to ensure that all designed components would fit and interact properly before creating the other drive boxes. After completion of the first drive box and implement minor changes for manufacturing ease, we then started our stretched goals which was completing all three other drive boxes. During both manufacturing phases of the drive boxes, one or two of our group members worked on the structural frame modification which ended up being one of the most times consuming area of the building phase. 

Critical documentation deadlines were also set as milestones. These reports and presentations were typically done nearing the end of the every phase. This had as advantage to include all current changes before submission of the documents and to have all necessary information to complete the report at once, instead of someone waiting on the information. 

Finally, our team spent hours on building and manufacturing. Our initial estimate of the time needed to complet the project was 182 hours on the CNC Lathe, 146 on the CNC mill and 61 hours on frame accommodation. This thus needed us to spend at a minimum 30 hours a week on manufacturing alone. In total, all member of the team gave 270 hours in manufacturing which is reflected in the Gantt chart. The final Gantt chart can be found~\ref{fig:gantt} in Appendix~\ref{gantt}.
