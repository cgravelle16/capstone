\section{Project Management}

From the beginning, project management was an important tool used to keep our team working efficiently and on time  to be able too build and finish our proposed final design. Do to the inherent structure of the course, we added two main milestones, the design and build phase.The first haft of our semester was dedicated to designing our solution to the problem. During this time, we created a work schedule using WBS (Work Breakdown Structure) to get a better visual understanding of the scope and after created our initial Gantt chart. Since the first scope breakdown, the WBS and Gantt chart underwent many revision because of the fluctuating scope of our project kept adjusting to what would be reasonably possible in the amount of time allocated.\\

During the building phase, this was the time where we had the most milestones to acquire so that the project may be completed on time. We divided the task equally and rotated the task so that every group member would get a chance to gain experience in any particular manufacturing processes. We began to manufacture during the end of January where we spent 30 hours a week each while still going ot our classes. In the beginning, we set out to complete a single drive box. This was to make sure that all designed components would fit and interact properly before creating the other drive boxes.
