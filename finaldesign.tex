\section{Final Design}
The final design of the robots drive system is very similar to the proposed design provided to Penguin ASI in December. Using a belt drive over a chain drive was accepted through our proposal along with keeping it battery powered. The final design also had features that were in the proposed design, such as removable interior components, easy serviceability and keeping it as a modular design. After assembling one exterior drive box, some small design changes were made that were not noticed in the CAD model assemblies or were notified to us from Penguin Employees after the proposal report had been submitted.
